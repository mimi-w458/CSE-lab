   <p>Security Measures </p>
    <p>Why Security Measures are important:</p>
	<p>Implementing security measures in a company is much more than just an administrative formality;
		it’s a process to protect employees, assets, and ensure operational continuity. 
		In a world where risks can originate from various sources, including physical security, cybersecurity, and environmental risks,
		managing security in the corporate world is a complex challenge 
	</p>
	<p> Common Cyber Security Measures Include: </p>
	</p> - Secure Configuration:
	    -- Such as fixing known weakness or vulnerabilities through patching</p>
	 - Network Security:
	    -- Develops simple policies to counteract any risk through an automated technical response: 
	 - Malware Prevention: 
	    -- Any altercation of information carries with it a degree of risk that malware might be substituted,
		  but can be reduced by developing and implementing appropriate anti-malware tools :
	 - Managing identity and Access Management: 
	    -- All users should be provided with an appropriate level of system privileges and rights as per their roles and responsibilities: 
	 - Removable Media Control: 
	   -- All digital assets should be hardened from all data loss and credential theft : 
	 - User Education, Awareness, and Training: 
	   -- Ensures employees can do their job as well as help to keep the organization secure: 
	 - Virtual Private Network: 
	   -- VPN encrypts web traffic by creating a tunnel between the computer and the network, which hides activities from the Internet Service Provider: 
	 </p>
	 <p>When it comes to VPN’s, the encryption makes the data unreadable without the key. For data-in-transit, there are a few options for encryption. :
	<p> 	-Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
		-Secure Shell (SSH) 
		-Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) 
	</p>
