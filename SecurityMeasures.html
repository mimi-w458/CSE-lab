<p>Why Security Measures are important: </p>
<p>Implementing security measures in a company is much more than just an administrative formality;it’s a process to protect employees, assets, and ensure operational continuity. 
  In a world where risks can originate from various sources, including physical security, cybersecurity, and environmental risks,
  managing security in the corporate world is a complex challenge</p>
</p>
<p> Common Cyber Security Measures Include:
</p>
<p> - Secure Configuration:
--Such as fixing known weakness or vulnerabilities through patching</p>
		- Network Security:</p>
		--Develops simple policies to counteract any risk through an automated technical response:</p>
		- Malware Prevention: </p>
		-- Any altercation of information carries with it a degree of risk that malware might be substituted,</p>
		  but can be reduced by developing and implementing appropriate anti-malware tools:</p>
		- Managing identity and Access Management: </p>
		-- All users should be provided with an appropriate level of system privileges and rights as per their roles and responsibilities: </p>
		- Removable Media Control: </p>
		-- All digital assets should be hardened from all data loss and credential theft : </p>
		- User Education, Awareness, and Training: </p>

 </p>
 <p>When it comes to VPN’s, the encryption makes the data unreadable without the key. For data-in-transit, there are a few options for encryption. :
<p> 	-Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
-Secure Shell (SSH) </p>
	-Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) </p>
