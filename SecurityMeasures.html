   <p>Security Measures </p>
    <p>Introduction</p>
	<p>This first section is meant to immediately inform the reader of what the main topic is, 
		why it’s important, and ultimately provide a roadmap of information that they can expect to encounter as they keep reading.
		Basic information, such as definitions, and introducing concepts that relate to security measures. 
		Simple information such as how Security Measures are diverse types of programs that exist to protect vital information from ill-intended individuals.  
	<p> Common Cyber Security Measures Include:</p>
	<p> For this section, the main goal is to inform the reader of all the main commonly known types of Cyber security measures that exist and 
		introduce each one specifically followed by a brief explanation of why each one exists, and its purposes. The list will go from the 
		most popular methods of security measures down to the least known, but still relatively common. For example
		- Network Security   
		1. Develops simple policies to counteract any risk through an automated technical response 
	 <p>Best Practices for Preventing Cyber-attacks:</p>
	<p>In this section, the main goal isn’t to provide the reader with information on programs that will help them prevent cyber-attacks but will focus on practices / tips 
		that they themselves can implement daily which is meant to prevent any potential cyber-attack that they might have encountered otherwise. 
		There are hundreds of small practices one can implement to ensure that a well-established security measure is present, but there will likely be about 5-8 practices mentioned, 
		just to allow the reader to fully understand each one, and not overwhelm them with the amount of possible security measure practices that currently exist. 
	<p>Conclusion:</p>
	<p>Lastly, this section is going to be a brief overview of everything mentioned in the previous sections and will provide closure. 
		Alongside any suggestions/ recommendations of what the main takeaway of this subtopic is, and ultimately reinstating how important it is to use, 
		and implement certain practices as a means of preventing cyber-attacks from ill- intended individuals.
